    p1: "Hi, Iâ€™m Surya Suhas Reddy Sathi! My passion for technology began with **IRON MAN** and **ROBOT**, inspiring me to create innovative solutions that make an impact. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in AI, app development, and web development, embracing challenges that spark creativity and growth. Iâ€™m quick to grasp new concepts and unafraid to explore uncharted paths, always striving to innovate. Whether building machine learning models or designing apps, I bring energy and enthusiasm to every project, aiming to create something meaningful at every step.",
    p2: "Outside of work, I love enjoying life to the fullest. As a kid, I was always curious, often breaking toys to see how they worked. Now, I take pride in keeping things in top condition and love fixing broken items. With strong handyman skills in electrical work, carpentry, and repairs, I enjoy building things from scratch and fixing broken ones. I stay active with badminton, swimming, and find peace in riding motorcycles or going on solo drives. And of course, nothing beats a quiet moment with chai and Milk Bikis biscuits. My ultimate comfort. Whatever I do, I bring passion, determination, and a love for the process. Thatâ€™s just me!",
